# Credits

OMNeT++ has been developed by András Varga.

My advisor during my university years was Dr. György Pongor. OMNeT++ was named after his simulator Omnet, written in Object Pascal.
OMNeT++ was developed at the Technical University of Budapest, Department of Telecommunications (BME-HIT), and the web site 
was hosted there until 2003, even after I left the university.

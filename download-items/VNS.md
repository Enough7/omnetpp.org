VNS is a simulation framework that completely integrates the mobility and
network components in a transparent and efficient way, reducing the overhead of
communication and synchronization between different simulators. VNS provides
bi-directionally interaction between a microscopic mobility model and network
simulators such as OMNeT++.

VNS was developed by Ricardo Fernandes at DCC-FCUP and Instituto de
Telecomunicações, Porto, supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and
Technology (FCT) under the doctoral grant (SFRH/BD/61676/2009).

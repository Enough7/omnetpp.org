Simulation of adversarial queueing (high packet loss) events in computer networks.

AQTmodel allows one to simulate unstable queueing scenarios in the framework of
Adversarial Queueing Theory and Adversarial Queueing with finite buffers and
timing variations. The focus of this network simulator is to study network
packet loss in various instability scenarios. Adversarial models of traffic
generation replace probabilistic assumptions by considering the deterministic worst-case.

MiXiM is an OMNeT++ modeling framework created for mobile and fixed wireless
networks (wireless sensor networks, body area networks, ad-hoc networks,
vehicular networks, etc.). It offers detailed models of radio wave propagation,
interference estimation, radio transceiver power consumption and wireless MAC
protocols (e.g. Zigbee).

DEPRECATED - use INET Framework instead. Nearly all code in MiXiM have been
merged into INET 3.x.

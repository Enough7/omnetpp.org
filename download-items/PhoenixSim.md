PhoenixSim (Photonic and Electronic Network Integration and Execution Simulator)
is a simulation environment for designing and analyzing the performance of
photonic interconnection networks, developed by the Lightwave Research
Laboratory at Columbia University in the City of New York.

PhoenixSim enables detailed studies of electronic networks, photonic networks,
and hybrid networks (ones that leverage a combination of both technology
domains). The simulator is highly extensible and is currently being used within
the Lightwave Research Laboratory on projects for the design of on- and off-Chip
photonic communications for multi-processor systems, and the design of
nanophotonic optical broadband switches (NOBS).

Currently, the simulator supports the ability to model and characterize many
important properties of photonic interconnection networks including propagation
delay, insertion loss, extinction ratio, spectral resonant profiles, area
occupation, and energy dissipation. Moreover, future extensions will support the
modeling of thermal variations, optical nonlinearities, as well as
three-dimensional integration. In the realm of electronics, the simulator
includes a router model that can be used to model advanced electronic networks
and hybrid networks.

CloudNetSim++ is a modeling and simulation toolkit to facilitate simulation of
distributed datacenter architectures, energy models, and high speed data centers'
communication network. It is designed to allow researchers to
incorporate their custom protocols and, applications, to analyze under realistic
data center architectures with network traffic patterns.

CloudNetSim++ is the first cloud computing simulator that uses real network
physical characteristics to model distributed datacenters. CloudNetSim++ provides
a generic framework that allows users to define SLA policy,scheduling algorithms,
and modules for different components of datacenters without worrying about low
level details with ease and minimum effort.

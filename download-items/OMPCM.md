OMPCM is an implementation of the Palladio Component Model based on the OMNeT++
simulation framework. As OMNeT++ offers full network simulation support, the
influence of network effects on a modeled system can be investigated. It uses a
specialised representation for description of RD-SEFF behavior called SimCore.
By applying a series of model-transformations, a Palladio model can be
transformed full automatically to a OMNeT++ network definition file (NED) that
uses the developed OMPCM modules.

OMPCM was presented at 6th OMNeT++ Workshop (Cannes, 2013).

[Palladio](https://palladio-simulator.com) itself is a software architecture simulation
approach which analyses software at the model level for performance bottlenecks,
scalability issues, reliability threats, and allows for a subsequent
optimisation.

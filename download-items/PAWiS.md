PAWiS is an OMNeT++-based simulation framework for the optimization of wireless
sensor networks (WSN). The simulator has been developed within the PAWiS project
at the Institute of Computer Technology, University of Technology, Vienna. WSNs
require nodes with exceptionally low power consumption, yet have to drive
sensors and radio communication. Common optimization approaches concentrate on
modules to make every module as good as possible, but this approach only reveals
local optima. In contrast, the PAWiS Framework targets on cross layer and cross
module optimization to find global optimum.

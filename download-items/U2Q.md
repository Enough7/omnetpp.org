U2Q is a tool that allows developers to estimate the performance of a system
prior to prototypes based on UML models only.

U2Q is the implementation of a design methodology that allows developers to
estimate the performance of a system in very early stages of development where
no prototypes are yet available. Starting from a functional UML system model,
the developer enhances the system model by incorporating performance annotations.
From this performance aspects enhanced system model, U2Q generates Queueing
Networks as performance models which then may be analysed using analytical or
simulative approaches. The tool itself smoothly integrates into Telelogic Tau
G2 3.1 and brings a command line version.

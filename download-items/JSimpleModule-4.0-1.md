This is an extension that makes it possible to write OMNeT++ simple modules in
Java. Java and C++-based simple modules can be freely mixed in simulations.
Integration is not seamless though, there are limitations as to what OMNeT++
features are available, as well special coding rules to obey in the Java code.
This release is for OMNeT++ version 4.0 precisely, and will not work with other
versions.

xMIPv6 is an extensible Mobile IPv6 simulation model, based on the INET Framework.

This model is now part of the INET Framework.

xMIPv6 has been implemented with strict conformance to IETFâ€™s  Mobile IPv6
(MIPv6) protocol (RFC 3775), and its accuracy and reliability has been validated
against a real Linux based MIPv6 test bed.

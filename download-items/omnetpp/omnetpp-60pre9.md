A long time, six months have passed since the last prerelease, and, as a consequence, we have accumulated a lot of changes. Arguably the most important change is an update to the OMNeT++ programming model: the introduction of the possibility to update ongoing packet transmissions, that is, the ability to abort, shorten, or extend a packet (usually an L2 frame) while it is being transmitted. Significant amount of work has been put into improving the looks and functionality of Qtenv, and into refining the Python-based Analysis Tool in the IDE. There were numerous other improvements as well.

This model is a useful  modification of the well-known self-similar traffic
model "M/G/âˆž Input". The package is designed for the analysis of real WAN
traffic  traces, identification of model parameters and generation of a
synthetic  traffic, which is close to real one by a number of characteristics
simultaneously. These characteristics include traffic value probability
distribution, normalized auto-correlation function and Hurst parameter.

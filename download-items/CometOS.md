CometOS is a component-based, extensible, tiny operating system for wireless
networks. It is written in C++ and highly inspired by OMNeT++'s communication
paradigm. It allows the execution of protocols within the OMNeT++ simulation
environment as well as on resource-restricted platforms such as wireless sensor
nodes.

CellSignaling is a research project from GRXCA group at BarcelonaTECH,
Polytechnic University of Catalonia, developed to study the signaling and
communications of (biological) cells at a molecular scale. It has been used to
evaluate diffusion-based communication channels using calcium ions. It also
features a 3D, web based visualization component based on webGL.

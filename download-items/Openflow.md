Simulation model of the OpenFlow system for INET-2.0 and OMNeT++ 4.2, based on
the OpenFlow switch specification 1.0. Presented at the 6th International workshop
on OMNeT++ (Cannes, 2013).

Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a new paradigm for communication networks
which separates the control plane from the data plane of forwarding elements.
This way, SDN constitutes a flexible architecture that allows quick and easy
configuration of network devices. OpenFlow is currently the most prominent
approach which implements the SDN concept and offers a high flexibility in the
routing of network flows.

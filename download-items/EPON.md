This is a basic implementation of (1G) Ethernet Passive Optical Network (EPON)
for OMNeT++ 4.1. OLT and ONU modules are provided. MPCP protocol has been
implemented to assign LLIDs dynamically based on a global service configuration
module. Service differentiation is based on 802.1Q VLANs (included). Basic
implementation for both polling and non-polling DBAs is included (fixed
allocation per ONU in both cases).

This repository provides useful utilities to be used with the OMNeT++ network
simulation framework. It contains the following subprojects:

- Callable: Helper functions for classes that can be called directly from other classes.
- Channels: Additional channel definitions.
- DynamicSignals: Helper functions for registering signals during runtime.
- InitBase: Structured initialization of modules and subclasses of modules.
- ParameterParser: Helper functions to parse parameter strings to C++ enumerations.

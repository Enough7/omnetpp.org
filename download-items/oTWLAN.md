oTWLAN models a wireless ad-hoc network, which supports multi-level precedence
and preemption (MLPP) over a DSSS radio. This open source project facilitates
throughput/delay performance study through a GUI based user interface. oTWLAN
has many similar characteristics to WLAN (IEEE 802.11) but also provides a
100kbps radio channel for enlarged radio coverage, relaying of traffic for
increased service coverage area and priority handling of user traffic. The
latter is especially important for military and emergency network. The simulator
has been developed within the GOSIKT project at the Norwegian Defence Research
Establishment where we study the performance of PKI over tactical ad-hoc
networks. Chapter 2 in the user manual included in this open source project
illustrates the usage of the simulator while other chapters describe the network
protocols implemented.

This version requires OMNeT++ 3.3 and INET-20061020.

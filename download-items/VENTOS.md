VENTOS is an open-source integrated VANET C++ simulator for studying vehicular
traffic flows, collaborative driving, and interactions between vehicles and
infrastructure through DSRC-enabled wireless communication capability. VENTOS is
useful for researchers in transportation engineering, control theory and
vehicular networking fields. VENTOS is being developed in Rubinet Lab, UC Davis
since 2013 and is the main tool in the C3PO project.

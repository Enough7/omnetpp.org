NoSSim is a network/system co-simulation framework that combines a fast
and accurate host-compiled full system simulator with a standard,
reconfigurable OMNeT++ network simulation backplane. Detailed models of
network interfaces and protocol stacks (lwIP) are integrated into
host-compiled system and OS models to allow accurately capturing network
and system interactions.

NoSSim is demonstrated with two IoT application scenarios with different
sets of network/system configurations.

This model is a useful  modification of the well-known self-similar traffic model “M/G/∞ Input”. The package is designed for the analysis of real WAN  traffic  traces, identification of model parameters and generation of a synthetic  traffic, which is close to real one by a number of characteristics simultaneously. These characteristics include traffic value probability distribution, normalized auto-correlation function and Hurst parameter.

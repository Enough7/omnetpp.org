Chsim, created at University Paderborn, is an OMNeT++ simulation model  which
generates channel state values (1/attenuation) in dB for a single wireless cell.
This cell includes one base station and N terminals, each terminal can have M
unidirectional links to the base station. For each of these links channel state
values can be generated in the time and frequency domain. These values can be
written to a file or processed in own simulation modules. The simulator includes
several mobility and channel models.

Chsim has been superseded by MiXiM, and eventually, INET Framework.

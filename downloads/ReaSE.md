The ReaSE framework provides a graphical user interface for generation of ned files including a realistic topology and necessary traffic generation entities. In addition, OMNeT++ and the INET framework are extended in a way that hierarchical routing and traffic generation are enabled within a user's simulation model.


ReaSE is developed at the Institute of Telematics, University of Karlsruhe. This tool is actively developed and open to feedback and contributions. If you have any questions regarding ReaSE, feel free to contact the authors.

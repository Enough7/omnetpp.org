The DSL users D1 and D2 are each dedicated a link such that the bandwidth on the bidirectional link connecting D1 is 5Mbps, and for D2 it is 10Mbps. On the other hand, all N TDM users share a single channel of total capacity 100Mbps in both the upstream and downstream directions, and are allocated bandwidth in the upstream direction in a TDM fashion (i.e., each user Ti =1…N gets a fixed timeslot in every TDM frame).

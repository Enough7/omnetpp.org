LimoSim represents a lightweight and integrated approach for simulating
vehicular mobility directly in INET Framework, without the need for
co-simulation with an external traffic simulator like SUMO.

LimoSim has been presented at
[4th OMNeT++ Community Summit, Bremen 2017](https://summit.omnetpp.org/archive/2017/)
(slides and paper available behind the link).

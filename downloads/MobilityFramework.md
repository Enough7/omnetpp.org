DEPRECATED: This model have been merged into the INET Framework.

Supports wireless and mobile simulations within OMNeT++. The core framework
implements the support for node mobility, dynamic connection management and a
wireless channel model. Additionally the core framework provides basic modules
that can be derived in order to implement own modules. With this concept a
programmer can easily develop own protocol implementations for the Mobility
Framework (MF) without having to deal with the necessary interface and
interoperability stuff.

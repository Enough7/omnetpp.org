This project contains an OMNeT++/INET extension to support IEC61850 process bus
communication (GOOSE and SV). The followings simulation models were developed:

- Merging Unit simulation model that permits to configure the sample rate
  (protection profile and measurement profile).
- Protection and Control (P&C) IED simulation model that process SV and GOOSE
  messages but only generates GOOSE messages.
- Networking Switch simulation model that suports IEEE 802.1q VLAN and Priority
  Tagging using fixed priorities Queues. This project is intended for
  educational purpose.

The mission of the oProbe open source project is to provide an instrument that
produces statistically sound results at known quality. Stochastic sampling from
a network of queues demands both confidence and correlation control.

An important design goal is to be compatible with the OMNeT++ 3.3 framework
without introducing changes to this code, as well as making it easy for existing
simulators to make use of oProbe. The oProbe project introduces a probe module,
which is a new simple module in the context of OMNeT++. A probe is the
instrument that applies a controlled stochastic sampling technique. The probe
module may have any number of probes. The oProbe project supports different
interface levels according to the functionality required. Based on the FIFO
queue example included in the sample directory in OMNeT++, the oProbe project
provides example code on how the software can be used by existing or upcoming
OMNeT++ based simulators.

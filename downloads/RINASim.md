RINASim is a stand-alone framework for OMNeT++ discrete event simulator
environment. RINASim is coded from scratch and independent on another library.
The main purpose is to offer the community with reliable and the most up-to-date
tool (in the sense of RINA specification compliance) for simulating RINA-based
computer networks. RINASim at its current state represents an entirely working
implementation of the simulation environment for RINA. The simulator contains
all mechanisms of RINA according to the current specification.

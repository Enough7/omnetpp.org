All-optical simulator based on OMNeT++. This simulator implements a new paradigm
of Optical Burst Switching (OBS) framework called Car OBS that concatenates a
number of burst for better link utilization.

In order to use a given network topology as efficiently as possible, stream-line
effect (SLE) is used. Then combination of SLE routing and wavelength assignment
(RWA) with grooming provided by OBS framework GRWA algorithm is proposed and
verified. This verification was tackled by this simulator.

This is an extension that makes it possible to write OMNeT++ simple modules in Java. Java and C++-based simple modules can be freely mixed in simulations. Integration is not seamless though, there are limitations as to what OMNeT++ features are available, as well special coding rules to obey in the Java code. This release is for OMNeT++ version 4.0 precisely, and will not work with other versions.

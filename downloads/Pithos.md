Pithos is a reliable, responsive, secure, fair and scalable distributed storage
system, ideally suited to P2P MMVEs (peer-to-peer massively multi-user virtual
environments). The Pithos simulation model is implemented in Oversim, which runs
on the OMNeT++ network simulator.

Pithos represents the implementation work of the PhD of John Sebastian Gilmore
under Dr. Herman Engelbrecht at the Stellenbosch University's MIH Media lab.

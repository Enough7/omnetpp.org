The main goal of SIMCAN is to simulate large complex storage networks. Moreover,
with this simulator, high performance applications can be modelled in large
distributed environments. Thus, SIMCAN can be used for evaluating and predicting
the impact of high performance applications on overall system performance.
SIMCAN is based on the INET Framework, and features an own GUI.

DEPRECATED - use INET Framework instead. All featuress of MiXiM have been merged into INET 3.x
MiXiM is an OMNeT++ modeling framework created for mobile and fixed wireless networks (wireless sensor networks, body area networks, ad-hoc networks, vehicular networks, etc.). It offers detailed models of radio wave propagation, interference estimation, radio transceiver power consumption and wireless MAC protocols (e.g. Zigbee).

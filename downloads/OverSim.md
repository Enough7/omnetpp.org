OverSim is an open-source overlay network simulation framework for the
OMNeT++/OMNEST simulation environment. The simulator contains several models for
structured (e.g. Chord) and unstructured (e.g. GIA) peer-to-peer protocols.

OverSim is developed at the Institute of Telematics, Universit√§t Karlsruhe (TH)
within the scope of the ScaleNet project funded by the German Federal Ministry
of Education and Research.

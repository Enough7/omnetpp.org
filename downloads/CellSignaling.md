CellSignaling is a research project from GRXCA group at BarcelonaTECH,
Polytechnic University of Catalonia, developed to study cell signaling
communications at a molecular scale. It has been used to evaluate
diffusion-based communication channels using calcium ions. It also features a
3D, web based visualization component based on webGL.

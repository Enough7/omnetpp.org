This is a simulation of LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a well-known cluster-based protocol for sensor networks with an extension to make it solar-aware. THIS 1.01 VERSION FIXES A CRASH FOUND IN THE ORIGINAL RELEASE.

This simulation was created for the following paper:

  Thiemo Voigt, Hartmut Ritter, Jochen Schiller, Adam Dunkels, and Juan
  Alonso. Solar-aware Clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks. In
  Proceedings of the Ninth IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications,
  June 2004.

  Abstract:
  "Energy conservation plays a crucial in wireless sensor
  networks since such networks are designed to be placed in
  hostile and non-accessible areas. While battery-driven sensors
  will run out of battery sooner or later, the use of renewable
  energy sources such as solar power or gravitation
  may extend the lifetime of a sensor network. We propose to
  utilize solar power in wireless sensor networks and extend
  LEACH, a well-known cluster-based protocol for sensor networks
  to become solar-aware. The presented simulation
  results show that making LEACH solar-aware significantly
  extends the lifetime of sensor networks."

This project exploits discrete simulation of a network for automated analysis of
security properties. Network topology is formally built using nodes (e.g.,
routers) and links. Nodes include network interfaces with IP addresses,
filtering rules (express using ACLs), and routing processes. Using automated
simulation with changing configuration (links going up and down), dynamic
behaviour of the network is observed and analyzed. The goal is to find out weak
points of the network design and configuration.

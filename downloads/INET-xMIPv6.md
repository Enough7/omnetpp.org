DEPRECATED - this is now part of the INET Framework.
xMIPv6 is an extensible Mobile IPv6 simulation model, based on the INET Framework.

  xMIPv6 has been implemented with strict conformance to IETFâ€™s  Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol (RFC 3775), and its accuracy and reliability has been validated against a real Linux based MIPv6 test bed.

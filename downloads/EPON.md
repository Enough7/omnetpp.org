This is a basic implementation of Ethernet Passive Optical Network by Andreas B.
OLT and ONU modules are defined and they both suport one or multiple LLIDs. MPCP
protocol has been implemented on OLT and ONU models to assign LLIDs dynamically.
Since it is under development, many features may be missing.

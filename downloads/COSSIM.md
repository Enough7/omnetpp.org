The COSSIM simulation framework is the first known open-source, high-performance
simulator that can handle holistically system-of-systems including processors,
peripherals and networks; such an approach is very appealing to both CPS and
Highly Parallel Heterogeneous Systems designers and application developers.

COSSIM is built on top of several well-established simulators:

- GEM5, a state of the art full-system simulator, to simulate the digital
  components of each processing node in the simulated system.
- OMNeT++, which is an established network simulator, to simulate the networking
  infrastructure.
- McPAT to provide energy and power consumption estimations of the processing
  nodes and MiXiM (OMNeT++ addon) to estimate the energy consumption of the
  network.

To bind the whole framework together, COSSIM employs the HLA architecture
through the open-source CERTI package. Additionally, a sophisticated
Eclipse-based GUI has been developed to provide easy simulation set-up,
execution and visualization of results.

COSSIM was developed under the EU Information and Communication Technologies
(ICT) Programme Project No: H2020-644042.

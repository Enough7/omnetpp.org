The OMNeT++ source code repository is now available on GitHub as 
[omnetpp/omnetpp](https://github.com/omnetpp/omnetpp). 
This allows anyone to browse the development history, and follow the 
development of new versions as it takes place.
Making the repository open has been a long-standing wish of several community members,
and we hope that it will be beneficial for all parties involved.

We also switched to using the GitHub's issue tracker for OMNeT++-related issues.
The contents of the existing Mantis-based issue tracker has been migrated 
to [GitHub](https://github.com/omnetpp/omnetpp/issues).
The [old issue tracker](https://dev.omnetpp.org/bugs) is still online, but runs in read-only mode.
Unfortunately, reporter/commenter names could not be migrated, so if you've been watching
an issue, you'll need to manually subscribe to notifications of the corresponding issue on GitHub.

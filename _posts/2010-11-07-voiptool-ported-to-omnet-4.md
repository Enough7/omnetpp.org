excerpt: 'This is to announce VoIPTool 2.0, a realistic VoIP traffic generation and
  evaluation tool for the INET Framework and OMNeT++ 4.1. The package is an evolution
  of <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/research/omnetVoipTool/"
  href="http://www.tkn.tu-berlin.de/research/omnetVoipTool/">VoIPTool 1.x</a> from
  Mathias Böhge and Martin Renwanz (TKN, TU Berlin): the code has been moved to github
  (as project <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/inet-framework/voiptool"
  mce_href="https://github.com/inet-framework/voiptool">inet-framework/voiptool</a>),
  ported to OMNeT++ 4.x, and its external interface (parameters, etc.) and implementation
  has been revised. The package provides a VoIP source and a VoIP sink module as UDP
  apps. The source app transmits the contents of an audio file (mp3, wav, etc.) to
  the sink app as VoIP traffic, which can save it to an output audio file for later
  evaluation. Current maintainers are Zoltán Böjthe and Andras Varga. <a target="_blank"

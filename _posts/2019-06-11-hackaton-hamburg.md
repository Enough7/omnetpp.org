title: OMNeT++ Summit Hackathon - Call for Proposals
category: Articles
---
After the great success of the first Hackathon in Pisa last year, a [similar Hackathon is again going to be organized](https://summit.omnetpp.org/2019/assets/pdf/CFP-OMNeT2019-Hackathon.pdf) together with this year's [OMNeT++ Community Summit](https://summit.omnetpp.org).

Hackathon Date: September 04-05, 2019

Hackathon Proposal Deadline: August 10th, 2019

The hackathon gives developers of simulation models and simulation frameworks the chance to consult and team-up with the OMNeT++ core developer team and fellow framework developers, in order to improve the quality and interoperability of simulation models and frameworks and to work on topics proposed by the developers themselves. Participants and topics will be selected based on prior written project proposals.

Exemplary topics for hackathon projects:

- port an existing codebase to recent versions of OMNeT++ / INET;
- introduce regression tests (i.e., fingerprint testing);
- add "project features" support if needed (for large projects);
- add visualization (e.g., using figures, layers, 3D visualization);
- discuss the practice of simulation result collection and analysis;
- discuss interoperability and OMNeT++ development roadmaps;
- include new features of INET 4.x;
- hands-on problem solving (e.g., improving scalability);
- set up continuous integration (e.g., Travis);
- improve certain aspects of existing simulation models;
- improve interoperability with other frameworks;

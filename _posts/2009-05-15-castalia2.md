excerpt: "Castalia 2.0 (for OMNeT++ 3.x) has been released. Castalia is a\r\nsimulator
  for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Body Area Networks (BAN),\r\nand generally networks
  of low-power embedded devices. It offers an\r\nadvanced channel model based on empirical
  measurements that supports\r\nmobility and temporal variability. It also offers
  many features that\r\nare often neglected in network-level simulation, such as realistic\r\nradio
  modeling and access, node clock drift, and physical process\r\nmodeling. Castalia
  is an expandable, modular and user-friendly\r\nsimulator with a growing research
  community. For more info go to <a href=\"http://castalia.npc.nicta.com.au/\">http://castalia.npc.nicta.com.au</a>."

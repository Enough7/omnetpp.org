excerpt: "The <b>2nd International Workshop on OMNeT++</b> took place last week in
  Rome, Italy. It was a great success: 18 papers and posters were presented (selected
  from nearly twice as many submissions!), and we again filled the room for the most
  part of the day, with about 40 people being present. With the INET@github discussion
  and the hands-on tutorial on the upcoming MiXiM model framework, the program ended
  after 7pm, and then we went out for  an informal dinner in a nice nearby restaurant.
  \r\rYou'll find the programme on the workshop site, together with the slides of
  the presentations: <a href=\"http://www.omnet-workshop.org/2009/techprog.shtml\">http://www.omnet-workshop.org/2009/techprog.shtml</a>."

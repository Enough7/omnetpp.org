excerpt: 'The MiXiM team is happy to announce the first official MiXiM release, <b>MiXiM
  1.0</b>. <a href="http://mixim.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" mce_href="http://mixim.sourceforge.net/">MiXiM</a>
  is an attempt to merge several OMNeT++ simulators written to support mobile and
  wireless simulations. This release contains only the parts of MiXiM which we considered
  tested and stable enough for release. These are: <br /><ul><li>a base model for
  a detailed wireless physical layer</li><li>analogue model implementations for "Jakes
  fading", "Lognormal shadowing" as well as a simple path loss model </li><li>a CSMA
  Mac layer and a 802.11 Mac layer </li><li>mobility pattern modules known from the
  Mobility Framework (like Tractor-, Turtle- and CircleMobility) <br /> </li></ul>MiXiM
  can be downloaded from the project''s Sourceforge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=176959&amp;package_id=203648"

  <br /><br />Still in development are implementations of a S- and T-Mac protocols.
  You can find the parts which are still in development in the git repository''s "development"
  branch. Also, Jérôme Rousselot has written a MiXiM branch which contains a detailed

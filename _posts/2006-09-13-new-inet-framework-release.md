  MAC implementation which models the 802.11 protocol more closely, additional modules
  to implement management layer functionality for infrastructure mode (scanning, authentication,
  association, etc), and several improvements in the wireless infrastructure (multi-channel
  support with channel switching, bitrate switching, propagation delay modelling,
  etc). [<a href="index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_details&gid=2091">download</a>]

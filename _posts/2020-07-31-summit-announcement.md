category: Articles

Good news for those of you wondering about what will happen to the
annual OMNeT++ Summit in the year of the global pandemic:
Indeed there _will_ be a summit, an online one. This will give us
the chance to explore the advantages of the new format, while also
making participation for researchers and students from outside Europe
significantly easier. We are looking forward to having a geographically
much more diverse audience than in the previous years.

To facilitate real discussions and useful feedback, the online Summit
will be organized as informal presentations in small groups.
Also, this year we will skip requiring a formal multi-page paper
as submission, an abstract will suffice.

**Dates and other important details**: The planned Summit dates are
**October 5-6, 2020**. We foresee two half-day sessions.
Format: informal presentation in small groups.
Please send abstracts of your presentation via email
to Prof. Anna Förster (_anna.foerster@comnets.uni-bremen.de_).
**Submission deadline: <del>September 15, 2020</del>
<span style="color:red">Extended to: September 25, 2020</span>**.
More details will be announced later.

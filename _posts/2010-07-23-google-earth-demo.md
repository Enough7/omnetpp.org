  about it. The\r\ndemo simulates a wireless mobile ad-hoc network, where cars move
  about randomly over a\r\n2km-by-2km area. They have identical radios, with a transmission\r\nrange
  of about 500m; for simplicity, we assume that the area covered by\r\neach radio
  is a perfect circle. When two modes move within range of\r\neach other, they can
  communicate with each other, forming a (usually\r\ndisconnected) ad-hoc network.
  The purpose of the simulation study could\r\nbe to measure how long it takes to
  disseminate some piece of\r\ninformation to all nodes of the network. The communication
  itself is\r\nnot modeled in this demo. Visualization shows the mobile nodes\r\nthemselves
  (a 3D car model), their recent trails, their transmission\r\nranges, and the\r\ncurrent
  connectivity of the network."

excerpt: "<p><i><span style=\"font-size: small; font-style: italic;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">oTWLAN</span></span></i><span
  lang=\"EN-GB\"> models a wireless ad-hoc network, which supports multi-level\r\nprecedence
  and preemption (MLPP) over a DSSS radio. This open source project\r\nfacilitates
  throughput/delay performance study through a GUI based user\r\ninterface. <i style=\"font-style:
  italic;\" mce_style=\"font-style: italic;\">oTWLAN</i> has many\r\nsimilar characteristics
  to WLAN (IEEE 802.11) but also provides a 100kbps radio\r\nchannel for enlarged
  radio coverage, relaying of traffic for increased service\r\ncoverage area and priority
  handling of user traffic. The latter is especially\r\nimportant for military and
  emergency network. The simulator has been developed\r\nwithin the GOSIKT project
  at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment where\r\nwe study the performance
  of PKI over tactical ad-hoc networks. Chapter 2 in the\r\nuser manual included in
  this open source project illustrates the usage of the\r\nsimulator while other chapters
  describe the network protocols implemented. <br /></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-GB\"></span><span

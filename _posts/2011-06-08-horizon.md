excerpt: "<p>Horizon is a parallel simulation extension of OMNeT++ that focuses on
  multicore and/or multiprocessor machines. Horizon employs a centralized (master-worker)
  parallel event execution scheme which uses a conservative synchronization algorithm.
  This synchronization scheme is based on a new modeling paradigm that annotates discrete
  events with <i>durations</i> in order to create an opportunity for parallel processing.
  Horizon was originally written for OMNeT++ 3.3, and has been ported to 4.x recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Horizon

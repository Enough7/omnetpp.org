  is a Wireless Tutorial (<a href=\"http://omnetpp.org/doc/inet/api-current/tutorials/wireless\">also
  available online</a>), which is a recommended read for everyone into wireless simulations
  with INET. An animated screenshot from the tutorial can be seen below.</p>\r\n<p>INET
  3.4 also features advanced visualization. Visualizer modules are decoupled from
  the rest of the simulation, and can display physical objects (obstacles), movement
  trails, discovered network connectivity, discovered network routes, ongoing transmissions
  and receptions, radio signals, statistics, and much more. Nearly all visualizers
  support both the Canvas (2D) and OSG (3D) graphics. Instrument figures that can
  display statistics and other variables during simulation have also been added.</p>\r\n<p><img

  target=\"_blank\"><b>Plexe</b></a>, by Michele Segata, is an extension of Veins
  which permits the realistic simulation of platooning (i.e., automated car-following)
  systems. It features realistic vehicle dynamics and several cruise control models,
  permitting the analysis of control systems, large-scale and mixed scenario, as well
  as networking protocols and cooperative maneuvers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"line-height:
  15.8080005645752px;\">\r\n<li><a href=\"http://veins.car2x.org/documentation/modules/lte/\"
  target=\"_blank\"><b>Veins LTE</b></a>, by Florian Hagenauer, integrates Veins and
  two additional module libraries: SimuLTE provides the means of simulating cellular
  networks using LTE; the INET Framework provides general IP connectivity support
  and models of links using IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi. This integration allows Veins to serve
  as a unified Open Source framework for the simulation of heterogeneous vehicular
  networks using, for example, IEEE 802.11p DSRC, Wi-Fi, and LTE.</li>\r\n</ul>"

We are happy to announce the first preview release of OMNeT++ 5.0. The main
highlights of this release are extended logging facilities, and the new Canvas API
that allows your model to draw freely on the surface of a module.

<p>
This beta should be sufficiently stable for daily use, but does not yet contain
all changes we have planned for the 5.0 release. More betas can be expected
in the next months, adding the missing pieces. Download it <a href="http://omnetpp.org/component/jdownloads/category/31-release-test-versions?Itemid=-1">here</a>.

We are happy to announce INET Framework version 3.6.0. Go ahead and 
<a href="https://inet.omnetpp.org/Download.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">get it now</a>!

The most prominent new feature in this release is the introduction of a brand new 
IEEE 802.11 MAC model, written by Benjámin Seregi. This model replaces the old WiFi MAC 
model and allows a lot more flexibility for future enhancements.

We have created new tutorials and showcases that are available in the /showcases and 
/tutorials folders. Some of the new showcases are

Stay tuned for the rest of them coming in the following weeks...

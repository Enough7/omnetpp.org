The <a href="http://summit.omnetpp.org/2019/" target="_blank">6th OMNeT++ Community Summit (OMNeT++ 2019)</a> 
will be held at the Hamburg University of Technology from Wednesday to Friday, 
September 04-06, 2019.
The OMNeT++ Community Summit is an open meeting with time and space
for tutorials, discussions, coding sessions as well as presentations
on recent developments and novel ideas in the broad area of modeling
and simulation, with a focus on the OMNeT++ simulation framework.
To facilitate the interaction among participant, we introduce this
year a novel presentation format called *ConversTations*. It is a highly
interactive format, which provides much more feedback and useful
discussion time than traditional talks.
**Paper submission deadline: July 1, 2019**.

**Hackathon**. Following the success of 2018's edition, the 2019 Community Summit
will include a hackathon event. This provides the chance for
developers of simulation models and frameworks to consult and work together
with OMNeT++ core developers and fellow developers to improve the quality and
interoperability of models and frameworks. 
**Project proposal deadline: August 10, 2019**.

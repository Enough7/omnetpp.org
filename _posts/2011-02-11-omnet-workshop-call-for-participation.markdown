<p>OMNeT++ is a public-source, modular simulation environment with strong
GUI support and an embeddable simulation kernel. The continuing goal of this workshop is to bring together OMNeT++ 
developers and their tools, applications and ideas. It provides a forum 
for presentations of recent developments and novel ideas in the broad 
area of network simulation, with focus on OMNeT++ and on the important 
topics of integrating simulation models, coupling different simulation 
tools and providing more accurate and more efficient modeling 
approaches. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Evaluation and validation of simulation models
   </li><li>Comparison with other simulation/emulation tools
   </li><li>Parallel simulation and simulation control
   </li><li>Integration of hardware-specific code
   </li><li>Simulation in the loop
   </li><li>Cross-layer protocol design methodologies
   </li><li>Integration with other simulation tools
   </li><li>Result interpretation and analysis
   </li><li>Debugging
   </li><li>Simulation of communication networks
   </li><li>Industrial applications
   </li><li>Use of OMNeT++ in other domains
</li></ul>

<p>Important Dates:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Early registration deadline: Feb. 21, 2011
   </li><li>Workshop: March 21, 2011
</li></ul>

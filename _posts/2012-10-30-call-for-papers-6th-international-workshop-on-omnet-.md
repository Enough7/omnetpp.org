  International OMNeT++ Workshop</b></a> will be held on&nbsp;March 5th, 2013 in&nbsp;Cannes,
  French Riviera.&nbsp;All submissions to the workshop should be of interest to the
  general simulation and modeling community, with OMNeT++ playing a key role. We welcome
  case-studies that employ OMNeT++ in the evaluation of new systems as well as contributions
  addressing general questions of simulation using OMNeT++. For model-centric submissions
  we encourage the publication of source code on the authors'' website at the time
  of submission.</p><p>We invite two types of submissions:</p><ul><li>Full and short
  papers of 4 to 8 pages answering open research questions, introducing novel simulation
  techniques, or addressing questions of accurate and efficient modeling for simulation.</li><li>Poster
  abstracts of 2 to 4 pages describing work in progress, provoking research questions
  in the context of the workshop, or code contributions that sketch the underlying
  model.</li></ul><p>Submissions that are accepted and presented at the workshop will

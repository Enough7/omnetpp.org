Given the high volume of posts on the main OMNeT++ discussion list, it is easy for 
important posts like announcements to get lost in the noise. Several members of the 
community have suggested that a low-traffic list reserved for just announcements of 
various kinds would serve the community well, which led to the creation of the new 
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/omnetpp-announcements" target="_blank">omnetpp-announcements</a> 
list. 

Anyone may post, not only the OMNeT++ core team. In particular, we invite 
authors/maintainers of various simulation models/frameworks to post about new models, 
or new versions of existing models.Â  Other posts such as announcements about events, 
tutorials and other online content are also welcome.

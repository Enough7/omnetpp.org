excerpt: 'NETwork Attacks (NETA) is a framework devised to simulate attack behaviors
  in heterogeneous networks using OMNeT++. Due to the intensive research in the field
  of network security, with this framework we try to provide an useful tool to facilitate
  the estimation of impact, damage, of network attacks, and the development of possible
  defenses. This tool could have a direct use in demonstrating the effectiveness of
  defense (detection or response) techniques against network attacks or to compare
  the capabilities of different defense techniques among many other applications.
  NETA is a INET 2.1.0 based framework. Thanks to the versatile and extensible schema
  of NETA, a huge amount attacks could be implemented in each protocol layer. NETA
  tries to be a reference base tool for the network attacks simulation and implementation.
  It is delivered under GPL license for free use of the research community.&nbsp;<div><br

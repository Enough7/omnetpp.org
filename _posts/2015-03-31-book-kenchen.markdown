<p><img class="left" style="padding-right: 10px;" src="/images/stories/kenchen-book.jpg" alt="" width="99" height="139" />Last year we haveÂ <a href="http://www.omnetpp.org/22-page/3716-simulation-book-in-french" target="_blank">reported</a> about a French-language textbook on simulation written by Prof. Ken Chen (Universite Paris 13). The expanded version of the book is now available in English, published jointly by Wiley and ISTE. The book provides introduction into simulation and mathematical modeling as the most used methodologies for performance evaluation, and presents OMNeT++ as an example of simulation software, devoting an entire chapter to it. <i>"I am convinced that OMNeT++ is among the most suited and efficient tools for teaching simulation, and, IMHO, the first one in the open source category,"</i> the author writes in a private communication.</p>

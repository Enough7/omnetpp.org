excerpt: "<p>This release is the second snapshot of the development that has begun
  in early 2013, and will culminate in the release of INET-3.0. The code is now fairly
  stable and we do not expect major changes before 3.0.</p>\r\n<p>The highlights of
  this release are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Includes a new packet/bit/symbol level physical
  layer model for the 802.11 OFDM PHY according to the IEEE 802.11-2012 standard,
  and a hypothetical generic packet/bit/symbol level APSK physical layer model for
  further experimentation. The new implementations include forward error correction
  encoding/decoding, scrambling/descrambling, interleaving/deinterleaving, and modulation/demodulation.</li>\r\n<li>Contains
  fixes for more than 300 defects found by Coverity, an online C++ static code analysis
  tool. The reported Defect Density is decreased to 0.5/kLoC which is considered a
  result. You can find the detailed results at https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3472</li>\r\n<li>Contains
  several other memory leak and memory management fixes reported by valgrind memcheck.</li>\r\n<li>Modernizes
  C++ source code using new C++11 features such as nullptr, auto types, range loop,
  override, etc.</li>\r\n<li>A new tool to enable/disable INET features from the command
  line.</li>\r\n<li>Rewritten serializer classes</li>\r\n<li>SCTP improvements</li>\r\n<li>New
  IGMPv3, PIM-DM and PIM-SM models.</li>\r\n<li>Improved IPv4NetworkConfigurator</li>\r\n<li>TUN/TAP
  virtual network interfaces</li>\r\n<li>New wireless tutorial</li>\r\n<li>Added INET
  version macros (INET_VERSION, INET_PATCH_LEVEL)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/blob/v2.99.1/WHATSNEW\">what’s

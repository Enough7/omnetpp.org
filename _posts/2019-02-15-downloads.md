title: Simulation Models and Tools Catalog Revised
category: Article
---

As part of our efforts to improve the web site and serve the community better,
we have recently redesigned and expanded our simulation models download page,
and turned it into a model catalog. The resulting
[Simulation Models and Tools](/download/models-and-tools) page is easy to
browse, can be conveniently filtered and searched, and in general, makes
it significantly easier to find what you are looking for.

We would like to ask for your help to improve the accuracy and the completeness
of the catalog. If you have a few minutes to spare, please review the
entries on the models or tools you are familiar with, and
[let us know](https://github.com/omnetpp/omnetpp.org/issues/1)
if you find any errors or omissions.

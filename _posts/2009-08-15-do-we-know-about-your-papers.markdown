excerpt: "As you may have noticed, we have recently expanded our <a href=\"/publications\"
  mce_href=\"/publications\">Publications</a> database. First of all, it should now
  contain nearly all OMNeT++-related papers, from the beginnings until a few months
  ago -- presently <b>over 400 entries!</b> The database can be searched and filtered
  by words that occur in the title, authors, keywords, year, or abstract (yes, we
  store the abstracts as well, for better search results!). We have also added convenient
  \"Web link\" and \"Search web for title\" functions, so that you can find a copy
  and start reading as fast as possible. Entries are stored (and can exported) in
  <a href=\"http://www.bibtex.org/\" mce_href=\"http://www.bibtex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">BibTeX</a>
  format.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />Please help us make this database a useful reference!
  Check if it contains your papers, and if not, <a href=\"/get-involved/submit-paper\"
  mce_href=\"/get-involved/submit-paper\">submit</a> them. We are mostly interested
  in last years and earlier papers, because we'll periodically add the new ones by
  skimming various online databases anyway."

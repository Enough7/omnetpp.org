excerpt: <p>A new OppBSD version has been released which can be compiled and run on
  Linux (32/64-bit), Windows+MSVC and Mac OS/X, and has an extended documentation
  and other improvements. [<a href="index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_details&gid=2102">download</a>],
  [<a href="pmwiki/index.php?n=Main.OppBSD">Wiki page</a>]</p>  <p>OppBSD is an effort
  to get the network stack of the FreeBSD kernel working in OMNeT++ as a simulation
  model. In the model, every simulated host (or router) runs its own copy of the FreeBSD
  kernel's networking stack, and every host (router) has its own copy of all state
  variables of the FreeBSD kernel. </p>

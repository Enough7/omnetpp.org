excerpt: <p>Release 20060330 comes out after a long (but busy) period of improving
  INET code, and integrating new components. The <strong>MPLS, RSVP-TE and LDP models</strong>
  have been revised and mostly rewritten by Vojta Janota. Dynamic routing (OSPFv2
  and RIP) is now available via the  <a href="http://www.quagga.net/"><strong>Quagga</strong></a>
  <strong>routing software package</strong> (ported into the INET Framework by Vojta
  Janota), and alternatively, a cleanroom <strong>OSPFv2</strong> implementation (by
  Andras Babos). There is initial support for recording ns2 <em>nam</em> traces (Vojta
  Janota). Several bugfixes and improvements have been made, especially on TCP and
  UDP -- see the change log for details. [<a href="index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_details&gid=2097">download</a>]

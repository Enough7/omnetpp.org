excerpt: <div>The Veins project team have announced Veins 2.0, the latest version
  of their vehicular network simulation framework for OMNeT++. Veins is an open source
  Inter-Vehicular Communication (IVC) simulation framework composed of an event-based
  network simulator and a road traffic micro-simulation model, containing numerous
  improvements and new features.</div><div><br /></div><div>This release continues
  the framework's six year tradition of providing a comprehensive set of high quality
  models for the simulation of Inter Vehicle Communication (IVC) to an ever growing
  user base; now spanning 5 continents, including universities, governmental bodies,
  and independent research institutes as well as most major European automobile manufacturers.&nbsp;</div><div><br

Please see the Changelog for full details.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div>Changes from the last release candidate (veins-2.0-rc2) include:&nbsp;</div><div><ul><li>The IEEE 1609.4/802.11p MAC behaviour has been further optimized (minor bug fixes and performance tweaks)&nbsp;</li><li>The IEEE 802.11p Physical Layer and Decider have been improved. Interference/SNR computation is more robust and simplified frame capturing has been added.&nbsp;</li><li>Veins 2.0 now offers additional checks to validate user created experiments, full compatibility with clang and newer versions of gcc, delivers a more polished user experience, and offers many more available IVC centric metrics.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div>Detailed descriptions of all employed models and the results of extensive model validation can be found in the peer reviewed publications linked from <a href="http://veins.car2x.org/" mce_href="http://veins.car2x.org/" target="_blank">http://veins.car2x.org/&nbsp;</a></div><div><br /></div><div>I would like to invite everyone to download and try out Veins 2.0 -- as always, we will be happy to help with any open questions or problems during migration!&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>On behalf of the Veins core team,&nbsp;</div><div>Christoph&nbsp;</div>

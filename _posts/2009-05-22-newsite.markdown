excerpt: Dear OMNeT++ Users,<br /><br />Welcome to the new, redesigned OMNeT++ community
  site. The old, Geeklog-based website infrastructure has served us in the last 6
  years, but its age has started to show, and had to be replaced. The new website
  is based on Joomla, and we hope it will solve all our previous problems. A few things
  you should now:<br /><br /><ul><li>We have removed all the unused services. Calendars,
  polls, Web links are gone.</li><li>The forum was also dropped, as it was mostly
  a write-only medium, and the new mailing list will double as a forum too.<br /></li><li>The
  content of the site is mostly the same (we converted almost all content), but we
  have reorganized the site navigation a bit.<br /></li><li>A bibtex-based Publication
  Database was added for keeping track of OMNeT++ related papers. We made a good effort
  to collect publications from several online libraries and collections, but we don't
  know about the coverage. Please help us getting up-to-date by checking that it contains
  all your publications! You can submit the missing ones via a web form.<br /></li><li>A
  Model Catalog was added to gather all OMNeT++ models in a single place.</li><li>User
  accounts were not taken over from the old site. <b>Please re-register</b> on the
  new site if you wish.</li><li>We moved the mailing list to Google Groups. This allows
  you to follow the discussion via XML feeds, write to the group from the web directly,
  browse and search the archive in threaded mode. We have moved the old member list,
  however if you have recently subscribed to the omnetpp list, you may have to re-subscribe.
  The mailing list's address has changed, but the old list address still forwards
  to the new e-mail address. We are sorry for any inconvenience.</li><li>As a registered
  user, you will be able to submit news items, new models and publications.<br /></li></ul>

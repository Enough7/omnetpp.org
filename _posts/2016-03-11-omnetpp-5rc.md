excerpt: "<p>We are happy to announce that OMNeT++ 5.0 release candidate is <a href=\"component/jdownloads/category/31-release-test-versions\">available
  for download</a>. This release brings numerous refinements to APIs introduced in
  previous beta versions, several bug fixes, and relatively few new features. The
  manual has been improved and brought up to date for the most part, although there
  are still gaps that will be filled in for the final 5.0 release. The most conspicuous
  change will be the new simulation time display in Tkenv and Qtenv.</p>\r\n<p><a

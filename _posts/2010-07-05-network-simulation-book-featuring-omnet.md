  Tools for Network Simulation"</b> (Klaus Wehrle, Mesut Günes, James Gross [Editors],
  Springer, 2010) is a book that focuses on tools, modeling principles and state-of-the
  art models for discrete-event based network simulations. The focus of the "tools"
  part is on two distinct simulations engines: OMNeT++ and ns-3, where the OMNeT++
  chapter presents a high-level overview and rationale of the concepts, techniques
  and tools present in that simulation environment. The book also deals with issues
  like parallelization, software integration and hardware simulations. In the "modeling"
  part of the book, the wireless section covers all essential modeling principles
  for dealing with physical layer, link layer and wireless channel behavior, and presents
  detailed models for IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16 and other systems. Further chapters
  cover classical modeling approaches for higher layers (network layer, transport
  layer and application layer) and modeling approaches for peer-to-peer networks and
  topologies of networks. <br /><br />See the book''s page at <a target="_blank" mce_href="http://www.performance.rwth-aachen.de/publications/modeling-and-tools-for-network-simulation"

Here is a list of selected simulation models, model frameworks and other software available for
OMNeT++. With a few exceptions, models have been developed by the community,
that is, by research teams and individuals independent of the OMNeT++
core team. Models vary in the level of completeness, maturity, and the amount of
testing/validation received, so use them with caution. Contributions such as bug fixes
and porting to newer OMNeT++ or INET versions are usually welcome by the authors.

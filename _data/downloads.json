    "description": "This is a preview release demonstrating our completely revamped charting solution in the IDE. It is now completely based on Python3, with support for displaying Matplotlib charts right inside the IDE, accessing simulation results in the form of Pandas DataFrames, and using the built-in (older) charts from Python. Analysis files (.anf) created by older versions of the IDE (and vice versa) cannot be opened by this release, because the internal model changed substantially.</p><p>Samples:</p><ul><li>Added a new sample (pythoncharts) that contains the documentation, and some sample analysis files for the new Python-based plotting, using the data from the resultfiles sample.</li></ul><p>IDE:</p><ul><li>A completely rewritten Charts interface in the Analysis Tool.</li></ul><p> Some of the most important changes in the Analysis Tool compared to the first similar preview release:</p><ul><li>PyDev ( <a href='http://www.pydev.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>http://www.pydev.org/</a> ) is now integrated into the OMNeT++ IDE. It provides a more usable editing experience for the chart scripts - without having to use external .py files. It includes syntax highlighting, autocomplete suggestions, documentation tooltips, 'go to definition' functionality and more.</li><li>The chart scripts can now be 'live-edited'. Whenever the script changes in the source editor, it is executed again, and the chart is updated accordingly.</li><li>The standard output of the chart scripts is now printed in a proper Console, as one would expect.</li><li>Most Python runtime errors are now marked in the script editor and the Problems view.</li></ul><p>Other changes, not related to the Analysis Tool:</p><ul><li>Tkenv, and all references to it, has been removed.</li><li>Many deprecated classes and member functions in the simulation library have also been removed.</li><li>The `--msg6` option of the message compiler is now turned on by default.</li><li>The IDE now uses the GTK3 SWT backend. This means that for the built-in web browser engine to work, different WebKit-GTK packages need to be installed - `libwebkitgtk-3.0-0` instead of `libwebkitgtk-1.0-0`.</li></ul><p>Some known issues with the new Analysis Tool:</p><ul><li>The first time the IDE is started, an error marker saying 'Python not configured' might appear under every open project. This should disappear once an .anf file is opened.</li><li>An empty window named 'PartRenderingEngine's limbo' (that cannot be closed), might appear on first startup, when the first project is opened. This is Eclipse bug #473278 ( <a href='https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=473278' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/<wbr />show_bug.cgi?id=473278</a> ). This window closes when the IDE is closed, and does not appear again on further startups.</li><li>The splitter between the chart source and the chart itself, after it has been moved, sometimes gets stuck, and cannot be grabbed again. This is most likely an SWT bug. Resize the editor (vertically) to fix it.</li><li>There aren't any autocompletion suggestions for the built-in `results` or `chart` objects yet.</li><li>The interpreter configuration of PyDev is not used for running chart scripts. The first available `python3` program (in $PATH) is used, regardless of the PyDev configuration.</li><li>Clicking on an error marker in the Problems view does not reveal the corresponding chart in the editor.</li><li>The debugging capabilities of PyDev cannot be used on chart scripts.</li><li>Some runtime Python errors (especially ones occurring during rendering, or in custom event handlers) are not caught and marked in the editor. They are sometimes printed in the Console of the chart.</li><li> Analysis files (.anf) created with any older version still cannot be opened.</li><li> When a visual property of a built-in chart (i.e. one not using matplotlib) is edited using the dialog, its new value is instantly applied, even if the script should have overwritten it with a different value. The correct value (the one set programmatically by the script) is applied the next time the chart is refreshed (the script is executed).",

The HNOCS framework utilizes the OMNeT++ module interface feature to support runtime selection of simulation modules from a library of parametrized components. For example by setting the opCalcType parameter from 'XY' to 'XY/YX' the simulation change to use a different output port selection algorithm. The models provided support heterogeneous NoC configuration in terms of link capacity and number of VCs. HNOCS modules available today implement wormhole switching, with round-robin or winner-takes-all arbitration.

While battery-driven sensors <br/>  will run out of battery sooner or later, the use of renewable <br/>  energy sources such as solar power or gravitation <br/>  may extend the lifetime of a sensor network. We propose to <br/>  utilize solar power in wireless sensor networks and extend <br/>  LEACH, a well-known cluster-based protocol for sensor networks <br/>  to become solar-aware.

This model version works with omnetpp 3.0a3 and up.<hr id='system-readmore'> <br/> <br/>AntNet was proposed by Gianni Di Caro &amp; Marco Dorigo in [1] . In AntNet the  <br/>network state is monitored through two ant agents: Forward_Ant and  <br/>Backward_Ant. A Forward_Ant agent is launched at regular intervals from a  <br/>source to a certain destination. It uses the same queues as data packets to  <br/>monitor the real traffic situation. Forward_Ant agent is equipped with a  <br/>stack memory on which the address and entrance time of each node on its  <br/>path are pushed. Once the Forward_Ant agent reaches its destination it  <br/>creates a Backward_Ant agent and transfers all information to it.  <br/>Backward_Ant visits the same nodes as Forward_Ant in reverse order and  <br/>modifies the entries in the routing tables based on the trip time from the  <br/>nodes to the destination. At each node the average trip time, the best trip  <br/>time and the variance of the trip times for each destination are  <br/>maintained. The trip time values are calculated by taking the difference of  <br/>entrance times of two subsequent nodes pushed onto the stack. Backward_Ant  <br/>agent uses the system priority queues so that it disseminates the  <br/>information to the nodes as soon as possible. <br/> <br/>However, the authors later on renamed AntNet as AntNet-CL and proposed  <br/>another version of it in [2] namely AntNet-CO. AntNet-CO uses the concepts  <br/>of flying ants in which forward moving Forward_Ant agent does not have to  <br/>wait in the normal queues to determine the queuing delay rather they use an  <br/>estimation model described in [2] to estimate the delay. Consequently, the  <br/>routing information quickly spreads in the network. <br/> <br/>In this implementation of AntNet one could get the behavior of both  <br/>algorithms through a simple #define. The implementation has been tested and  <br/>works with Windows XP and MSVC6.0 and Omnetpp3.0a3. <br/> <br/>The steps are following <br/>1. Open protocolParameters.h file <br/>2. Go to line 38 that has #define _FLYINGANTS <br/>3. If you are interested in compiling AntNet-CL, then comment this line <br/>4. If you are interested in compiling AntNet-CO, then simply remove the <br/>   // from the beginning of this line. <br/>5. Rest everything remains the same <br/>6. Please ensure that Omnet++ is installed and all of its <br/>   libararies and bin are in the path. <br/>7. type 'opp_nmakemake -u Cmdenv' in the directory where you unzipped the antNet4.0.zip <br/>8. type 'nmake -f Makefile.vc depend' <br/>9. type 'nmake -f Makefile.vc' <br/>10. Congratulations:) you have compiled the program. <br/> <br/>In this implementation the most important files that are of interest are <br/>1. AntNest.cc <br/>2. Router.cc <br/> <br/>In AntNest.cc, the handling forward and backward ants is implemented. I  <br/>have tried to have implemented the concepts in this regard as discussed in  <br/>[1]. The parameters that are of interest could be given via omnet.ini file.  <br/>In Router.cc, i have just catered for the service time due to queues. <br/> <br/>Enjoy working with AntNet and thanks to Gianni and Dorigo for the wonderful  <br/>routing algrithm. <br/> <br/>In case of any problems please contact Muddassar Farooq muddassar.farooq@cs.uni-dortmund.de <br/> <br/>[1] G.

# Reporting bugs in OMNeT++

To report a bug or suggest an enhancement, log in to the OMNeT++
Bugtracker, and click Report Issue. Create an account if you do not have
one (anonymous bug reporting is not supported). Before submitting the
bug report, please check that the problem was not reported before by
someone else.**[](http://dev.omnetpp.org/bugs)**

> **[OMNeT++ Bugtracker](http://dev.omnetpp.org/bugs)**

<!--PageText-->

If you haven't submitted a bug report before, please read the following
pages carefully:

-   [Bug Writing
    Guidelines](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html)
-   [How to Report Bugs
    Effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/bugs.html)

The OMNeT++ IDE is based on [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)
and [CDT](http://www.eclipse.org/cdt). Before you report a
non-simulation related bug, please check the Eclipse bugtracker first:

-   [Eclipse Bugzilla](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs)

Also, if you are reporting an issue with the IDE, it might be useful to
include the log. It is located at `<your-workspace>/.metadata/.log`, by
default `omnetpp/samples/.metadata/.log`.
